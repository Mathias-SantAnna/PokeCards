### ADD SOMETHING

---
### Bugs discovered: 
#### Solved bugs
1. **Clicking the cards really fast caused too may cards to be face up.**

- Though my function to check a card match was set to activate when two cards were selected, clicking fast meant that 3 or more cards could be flipped over before the check for a match had been done.
    - Fix: Create a function to remove the event Listener to prevent the cards to be clicked again if it's a match. If it's not will be flipped back again.

```javascript
function disableCards() {
    firstCard.removeEventListener('click', flipCard);
    secondCard.removeEventListener('click', flipCard);
}
```
- In case it's not a match, when try to open a second pair of cards before the first one flips back crash the logic.
    - Fix: Create a function to lock the board till the cards have been flipped back.

```javascript
let lockBoard = false;

function flipCard() {
	if (firstClick){
        firstClick = false;
		startTimerCount();
	}
	
    if (lockBoard) return;
    if (this === firstCard) return;
    
    this.classList.add('flip');
    
    if (!hasFlippedCard) {
        //first click
        $('#FlipAudio')[0].currentTime = 0;
        $('#FlipAudio')[0].play();
        hasFlippedCard = true;
        firstCard = this;

        return;
    } 
    //second click
    hasFlippedCard = false;
    secondCard = this;
    $('#FlipAudio')[0].currentTime = 0;
    $('#FlipAudio')[0].play();
    checkForMatch();
    moveCounter = moveCounter + 1;
    document.getElementById('moves').innerHTML = 'Moves: ' + moveCounter;   
}
function unflipCards() {
    lockBoard = true;

    setTimeout(() => {
        firstCard.classList.remove('flip');
        secondCard.classList.remove('flip');
        
        resetBoard();
    }, 1200);
}
```

- Double click. In case that clicks too fast on the same card, in this case is match is evaluate true and disable the cards by removing the event listener.
  - Fix: Add a condition to beginning of flipcard function, and set resetBoard function as it set flippedCard, lockBoard to false and to set first,second card to null. As FlipCard function from above

```javascript
  function resetBoard() {
    [hasFlippedCard, lockBoard] = [false, false];
    [firstCard, secondCard] = [null, null];
}
```

#### Unsolved bugs

1. **Audio bugs in Chrome**

    - The Chrome browser sometimes delays some of the sounds. I haven't found the way around yet.

### Testing undertaken on tablet and make contact with devices

- All steps beneath had been repeated to check mobile specific elements at the developers several iPhones and Android telephones and tablet. 
And additionally withinside the Chrome Developer Tools tool simulators on all alternatives and orientations.
- Checked the participant data modal suits on small and medium monitors easily.
- Confirmed that font sizes are responsive so display screen length so it's miles displayed in a manner that every one customers can use.
- Confirmed fields and buttons are huge sufficient to click on easily, however small sufficient to healthy without problems at the display screen.
- Checked that participant data shows effectively on smaller monitors, now no longer an excessive amount of space, and no squashing or overlapping of factors even on smallest monitors.

# Testing Process

After the conclusion of the main structure of the project the validation process started. To check the acceptance of the website code the following systems were used:

1. W3C Markup Validation for HTML

2. W3C CSS Validation for CSS

3. JSHint for JavaScript

## Target Audience Testing

In this section, it will be analyzed the expected wishes raised in the User Stories presented in the README file for this project.

1. The possibility to quickly find and comprehend the controls for the game, to easily operate it.

- The possibility of the player select the "Let's Go!" button straight away not necessarily picking any character or Pokemon is the proof of accessibility of the game. This initial stage of the game was tested many times to ensure that any selection of character and Pokemon or either the skip option of this section will not influence the performance of the game. No glitches were found.

- The Score Board is clean and neat bringing functionality to the game. The timer was tested many times to ascertain how many seconds the target audience needed to complete the game and also if it was working fine showing the proposed game over warning message.

- The interface as a whole is achieving its purpose of communicating with the children and engaging them into the thematic world of **PokeCards**.

2. Attractive and large buttons that are easy to be used on any device.

- The large and colorful buttons to start or restart the game are easy and attractive captivating children's attention. All buttons were tested on all devices, it is working fine.

3. Audio or visual response while playing the game, so I can associate each move to an action understanding when I clicked something or when I have matched my cards.

- The audios' choice was picked based on Pokemon's soundtrack. A full checking of each click and each flip of the card was performed passing the test.

- The audio evaluation was run as well for the victory and game-over sounds. It is perfectly feasible.

4. The chance to find my favorite characters and Pokemons so I can engage the game.

- All the pokecards presented in the game are very alluring with a good range of Pokemons.

- The speed to flip each card was tested. The whole performance of the game is developed under the Pokemon's cartoon pleasing its fans.

5. Helpful audio feedback to indicate that I completed a stage in the game.

- A "bell" sound is played for a random appearance of cards and a "happier" sound is played when a correspondent match card is flipped. This sound feedback was extensively tested to check if there was any possible delays. But it was working according to programmed.

- The button's sounds are also very helpful to indicate a right move. It is also working fine.
