### **Design Description**

**PokeCards** design choice was inspired by the Pokemon cartoon. It was developed to attract its fans. It includes specific Pokemon features such as the card layout which was based on the Pokeball from the cartoon. It presents the main characters to be chosen as a player followed by three options of the most famous Pokemons to be selected. The cards for the memory game were carefully chosen to captivate Pokemons fans with great quality in the image.

**1. Fonts**

The Fonts reflect Pokemons essence relying on the animated letters that remember the design used in the cartoon. The fonts have a happy and understandable style including the fonts used in the images facilitating children's engagement.

**2. Icons**

All icons were picked with the specific purpose to add a friendly and compact visual complementing the Pokemon thematic presented in the whole project.

**3. Colours**

The colours are passing the adventurous impact promoted by Pokemon's journey presented on the cartoon at the same time it is professionally presenting the game in a clean and neat way in harmony with the images.

**4. Styling**

Cards and chart boxes were drawn with round corners to bring a soft and friendly theme. Children's physical cards are designed cornerless for safety reasons. This pattern is followed consistently fully in the whole project.

**5. Backgrounds**

- **PokeCards'** main background image brings in a clean and friendly way the most famous and traditional Pokemons of the cartoon promoting engagement and classic style for the game.

- The welcome background presented in a pop-up version was selected to make the reference to the Pokeball main instrument used in the game to catch the Pokemons.

- The congratulation's pop-up also at the completion of the game provides a very appropriate image from the main character "Ash" holding a trophy.
