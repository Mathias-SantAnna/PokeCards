## The Memory Game

**PokeCards** is an interactive and enjoyable memory card game created for children from 5 years old. The game includes entertaining sounds with attractive gift cards and a friendly interface very easy to operate. The opening selection of the characters *Misty, Brock and Ash* and Pokemons (Charmander, Pikachu, and Squirtle) refers to the main script of the cartoon Pokemon engaging, even more, its fans.

Neatly developed programming that helps children to increase their memory and spatial awareness through a fun and intuitive game. **PokeCards** was developed and tested to ensure that the game cannot be cracked by fast clicking in random areas for example.

As a player aged 5 years or more possible a Pokemon's fan, I wish:

- The possibility to quickly find and comprehend the controls for the game, to easily operate it.
- Attractive and large buttons that are easy to be used on any device.
- Audio or visual response while playing the game, so I can associate each move to an action understanding when I clicked something or when I have matched my cards.
- The chance to find my favorite characters and Pokemons so I can engage the game.
- Helpful audio feedback to indicate that I completed a stage in the game.

### **Design Description**

**PokeCards** design choice was inspired by the Pokemon cartoon. It was developed to attract its fans. It includes specific Pokemon features such as the card layout which was based on the Pokeball from the cartoon. It presents the main characters to be chosen as a player followed by three options of the most famous Pokemons to be selected. The cards for the memory game were carefully chosen to captivate Pokemons fans with great quality in the image.

**1. Fonts**

The Fonts reflect Pokemons essence relying on the animated letters that remember the design used in the cartoon. The fonts have a happy and understandable style facilitating children's engagement. As a primary font for this project, Acme was selected because this is a clean and friendly font. Montserrat is the secondary font and it was picked because it is a motivating and cheerful font.

**2. Icons**

All icons were picked with the specific purpose to add a friendly and compact visual complementing the Pokemon thematic presented in the whole project.

**3. Colours**

The colours are passing the adventurous impact promoted by Pokemon's journey presented on the cartoon at the same time it is professionally presenting the game in a clean and neat way in harmony with the images.

**4. Styling**

Cards and chart boxes were drawn with round corners to bring a soft and friendly theme. Children's physical cards are designed cornerless for safety reasons. This pattern is followed consistently fully in the whole project.

**5. Backgrounds**

- **PokeCards'** main background image brings in a clean and friendly way the most famous and traditional Pokemons of the cartoon promoting engagement and classic style for the game.

- The welcome background presented in a pop-up version was selected to make the reference to the Pokeball main instrument used in the game to catch the Pokemons.

- The congratulation's pop-up also at the completion of the game provides a very appropriate image from the main character "Ash" holding a trophy.

**6. Card Images**

The quality of the gif cards was highly considered in this project to amuse the Pokemon fans providing a stunning presentation of the game with shining cards. There is a great mix of Pokemons composing the cards bringing a variety of Pokemon species to attract the children.

**7. Audio Directory**

**PokeCards** is directed by animated audios to indicate if the move was a match of cards or a random flip of them facilitating children's to operate the game. A nice and fun audio is added into the clicking buttons to signal the navegation to the children. There is also an audio for when the time is up and the game over warning comes up. The victory audio is also available motivating the player to keep practicing their memory skills with the game.

**8. Wireframes**
